- Created the directory `./skills/github-copilot-monitor/` locally for the `GitHub Copilot Monitor` skill, which retrieves Copilot usage and billing information using GitHub APIs.
- Configured the following files for the skill:
  - `SKILL.md`: Includes a detailed description of the skill and setup instructions.
  - `scripts/github_copilot_usage.py`: Python script to interact with the GitHub API and fetch Copilot billing and usage details.
- The necessary folders for assets and references were also created but are yet to be populated.
- Recommended testing the skill locally before uploading it to GitHub.
